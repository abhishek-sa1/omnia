# This file is used to specify the network configuration.
#
# The variables in this file are divided into two sections: 'admin_network' and 'bmc_network'.
# 'admin_network' is a mandatory field, essential for PXE boot and host communication."
#
# The 'admin_network' section contains the following variables:
# - 'oim_nic_name': The name of the interface on the OIM server associated with the admin network.
# - 'netmask_bits': The number of bits in the subnet mask.
# - 'primary_oim_admin_ip': The admin IP address of the OIM server which is configured.
# - 'primary_oim_bmc_ip': The iDRAC  IP address of the OIM server,
#     Mandatory only if idrac_telemetry is set to true and telemetry data needs to be collected from the OIM server.
#     Optional â€” can be omitted if iDRAC telemetry for the OIM server is not required.
# - 'dynamic_range': The range of dynamic IP addresses available on the admin network.
