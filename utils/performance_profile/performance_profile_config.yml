# This configuration file is used to set up performance tuning for an Intel Gaudi GPU.
# It specifies a performance profile and allows to modify or add system parameters
# using various plugins such as sysctl, cpu, disk etc. Users can provide multiple
# parameters under each plugin. If there is no need to modify the profile, the
# 'performance_profile_plugin' section can be left blank.
